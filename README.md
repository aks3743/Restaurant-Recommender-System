# Restaurant-Recommender-System


### Introduction
Recommender system finds its application in many aspects of the online ecosystem including product
recommendation, movie recommendation, books, news, video recommendations to name a few. Here in this
project, we attempt to recommend restaurants to customers. The user can type in a restaurant name and the
recommender system will return the top 10 similar restaurants to the given input.
### Dataset
The dataset given here is taken from Kaggle and consists of two csv files. One file comprises restaurant names
and its related information and the second file consists of the restaurant reviews. It is expected of you to
combine both data files as required to develop the recommendation engine. You might have to apply text
analysis on the data to identify the cuisines or keywords in reviews that might help with the recommendation.
### Tasks 
1) Write a Data Science Proposal for achieving the objective mentioned.
2) Perform exploratory analysis on the data and describe your understanding of the data.
3) Perform data wrangling / pre-processing on the data if required
a. E.g., missing data, normalization, discretization, etc.
4) Apply feature selection engineering techniques
5) Identify top reviewed, rated and followed restaurants.
6) Identifying top 20 two-word frequencies for cuisines and reviews.
7) Implementing a recommender system giving top 10 similar restaurants to a given restaurant. (Eg.
Content based recommender)
8) Present the conclusions/results in the format shared.
